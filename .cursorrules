# Django Audit Log Project - Cursor AI Rules

# 1. Code Style and Readability
rule: Enforce PEP 8 and Django coding style for all Python code using ruff or flake8.
rule: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes).
rule: Use ruff for linting and formatting; code must pass lint checks before merging.

# 2. Project Structure
rule: Organize code into Django apps for modularity and separation of concerns.
rule: Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling.

# 3. Django ORM and Database
rule: Use Django ORM for all database interactions; avoid raw SQL unless necessary for performance.
rule: Use select_related and prefetch_related for query optimization when accessing related objects.
rule: Add database indexes for frequently queried fields.
rule: All model changes must be accompanied by a migration file.
rule: Migration files should be reviewed for accuracy and minimalism.

# 4. Views and Forms
rule: Use Class-Based Views (CBVs) for complex views and Function-Based Views (FBVs) for simple logic.
rule: Use Django's form and model form classes for form handling and validation.

# 5. Middleware
rule: Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and caching.

# 6. Error Handling and Validation
rule: Implement error handling at the view level using Django's built-in mechanisms.
rule: Use Django's validation framework for form and model data.
rule: Prefer try-except blocks for handling exceptions in business logic and views.
rule: Customize error pages (404, 500) for better user experience.

# 7. Security
rule: Apply Django's security best practices (CSRF protection, SQL injection protection, XSS prevention).
rule: Run Django's security checks (`python manage.py check --deploy`) before deployment.
rule: Regularly review and update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

# 8. Testing
rule: Use pytest-django for all new features and bug fixes.
rule: Require tests for all new features and bug fixes before merging.
rule: Ensure test coverage does not decrease.

# 9. Templates and Serializers
rule: Use Django templates for rendering HTML and DRF serializers for JSON responses.

# 10. Caching and Performance
rule: Use Django's caching framework (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data.
rule: Optimize static file handling using Django's static file management system or CDN integration.

# 11. Management Commands
rule: Implement custom management commands for batch operations and data migrations as needed.

# 12. Documentation
rule: Document all public classes, methods, and functions with docstrings.
rule: Update README.md or relevant documentation for all new features.

# 13. Environment
rule: Use `uv` for all environment actions.
rule: Do not use pip or poetry for environment management; use `uv` exclusively.
rule: All dependencies must be declared in pyproject.toml and locked with uv.

# 14. Git Commits
rule: Follow Conventional Commits specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
rule: Use commit message format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`.
rule: Common types: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), docs (documentation), style (formatting), refactor (code restructuring), test (adding tests), chore (maintenance).
rule: Use BREAKING CHANGE footer or ! after type/scope for breaking changes.
rule: Keep commit messages concise but descriptive; use body for additional context when needed.
rule: Examples:
  - `feat(auth): add user authentication middleware`
  - `fix: resolve user agent parsing for mobile devices`
  - `docs: update API documentation for new endpoints`
  - `refactor!: restructure user agent utility classes`

# 15. Code Review and CI
rule: All code must be reviewed and pass CI checks before merging.
